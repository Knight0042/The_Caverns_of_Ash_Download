# The_Caverns_of_Ash_Download
The Caverns of Ash is a 2D action adventure game where you fight past enemies to explore an extensive cave system. You can collect loot scattered around the cave in chests or you can take loot from enemies you have defeated. There is a full leveling system where you can exchange experience gained from turning enemies to ash into improved abilities. There is also a built in reset system in order to replay the game once you're done in the other settings menu.

This release is currently a concept demo of the game to get feedback and to gauge interest in the project. As a result, not all of the art is completed and game play is restricted to the first section of the game.  I encourage you to voice your thoughts on the game whether it be positive or negative.  I appreciate any and all feedback.  I hope you enjoy and thank you for your support!
